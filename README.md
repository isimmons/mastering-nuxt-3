# Mastering Nuxt 3 in Typescript

This is my version of the [Mastering Nuxt 3 Course](https://https://masteringnuxt.com/) project.

You can see a [Working Demo](https://sweet-sunflower-cab468.netlify.app/course) on Netlify.

Due to privacy settings for the videos, they only show when developing on localhost. I've added Big Buck Bunny as Chapter 1, Lesson 0 just to demo video play.
